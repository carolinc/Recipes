          <header> Lemon Pepper Chicken with Orzo </header>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
                <li>5 tsp lemon pepper seasoning</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp canola oil </li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>2.5 cups chicken broth</li>
                <li>1⁄4 bunch parsley</li>
                <li>1.5 cups orzo </li>
              </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>Blot the chicken thighs dry with a paper towel, then season both sides liberally with lemon pepper seasoning (about 1 tsp per chicken thigh).</li>
                  <li>Heat a large, deep skillet over medium flame. Add 1 Tbsp canola or vegetable oil. When the oil is hot (it should be shimmering), add the chicken thighs, skin side down. Allow the thighs to cook until browned, then flip and brown on the second side (about five minutes on each side for bone­in thighs with skin). Remove the cooked thighs to a clean plate.</li>
                  <li>While the thighs are browning, mince two cloves of garlic and roughly chop 1⁄4 bunch of parsley.</li>
                  <li>After removing the chicken from the skillet, pour off the excess fat and turn the heat down to low. Add the garlic and sauté for about one minute. Add the chicken broth and stir to dissolve the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
                  <li>Add about half of the chopped parsley, one additional teaspoon of lemon pepper seasoning, and the orzo to the skillet. Stir to combine. Return the chicken thighs to the skillet, skin side up.</li>
                  <li>Cover the skillet and turn the heat up to high. Allow the broth to come to a boil, then turn the heat down to low. Let the skillet simmer on low for 10­12 minutes, or until the orzo is tender. (If the broth stops simmering, increase the heat slightly to keep it simmering.)</li>
                  <li>After 12 minutes, the orzo should be tender and most of the broth absorbed. If there is still too much liquid, allow it to simmer without the lid for a few minutes. It's okay if the orzo is slightly saucy. Sprinkle the remaining parsley over top along with the crumbled feta.</li>

          <header> Slow Cooker Chicken Ropa Vieja </header>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>1.5 to 2 lb.s chicken pieces (boneless skinless) </li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>1⁄2 Tbsp oregano /li>
                <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
                <li>1⁄8 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
                <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
                <li>1 medium green bell pepper </li>
                <li>1 medium red bell pepper </li>
                <li>1 15oz. can diced tomatoes </li>
                <li>3 Tbsp tomato paste </li>
                <li>salt to taste (1/2 tsp) </li>
              </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>Trim the chicken pieces of excess fat, if desired. Place the chicken pieces in the bottom of the slow cooker (4qt. or larger). Mince the garlic and add it to the slow cooker. Sprinkle the oregano, cumin, red pepper flakes, and some freshly cracked pepper over the chicken.</li>
                  <li>Slice the onion, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper into strips. Place the onion and bell peppers on top of the chicken in the slow cooker. Add the can of diced tomatoes (with juices) and tomato paste to the slow cooker. The tomato paste can be added in dollops and will be stirred in after cooking.</li>
                  <li>Place the lid on the slow cooker and cook on high for four hours. After four hours, remove the lid and use tongs to stir the contents. Break the chicken into shreds as you stir the slow cooker. If the juices in the slow cooker are too thin, allow the pot to continue simmering on high without the lid for about 15 minutes to reduce the liquid. Taste and season with salt as needed (I added 1⁄2 tsp).</li>
